Welcome to CakeManager Utils documentation!
=====================================

Introduction
------------

The Utils plugin offers you many components and behaviors to make developing easier. 
This plugin is required by the CakeManager plugin, but it's good in use as individual plugin!

In first place this plugin is very useful for my personal projects, but I want to share it with other developers, and hope others will share their stuff via this plugin.

The goal is to extend this plugin to a great place where the best tools will be available for your projects.
